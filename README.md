# Bayesian Portfolio Optimization

This repository is an introduction into portfolio optimization theory with bayesian statistics and will help you to understand the key concepts of these fields with hands-on style.

This project is on going and its contents have been updating, but the following topics will be added in near future.

### Part1: Advanced Topics of Statistics
- MCMC
  - Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
    - independent sampler
    - Metropolis algorithm 
  - Gibbs Sampling
  - Simulated annealing
- Filter Theory
  - Kalman Filter
- Markov Swithcing Model
- Stochastic Control

### Part2: Portfolio Optimization
- Basic Topics
  - CAPM
  - Zero Beta Portfolio
  - Minimum Variance Portfolio
- Black Litterman Model
- Time Structure of CAPM
  - Kalman Filter
  - Regime Switch
- Merton Model with Stochastic Control
- CVAR Optimization

Almost all source codes in this repository are converted from .ipynd into .py by using jupytext to make it easy to be managed in github.
But you can reverse them in your local project.
